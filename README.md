This project implements a real-time touchless media control system using hand gestures on the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano. Using MediaPipe and OpenCV, the system detects hand landmarks and recognizes predefined gestures. Users can control media playback functions like play, pause, stop, and volume without touching any device.
